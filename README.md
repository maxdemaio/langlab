#### Welcome to LangLab! It's an open-source foreign language learning website for language learners of all levels.

### What is this website for?
It's for practicing the conjugations 25 most common verbs of a target language and finding great resources you enjoy to supplement learning.

### Why did you create this website?
I wanted to make a website where language learners (mostly beginners-intermediate learners) can practice their skills and have a home base for resources.

When I was learning French in middle school, I found it very easy to rank up my skills by quickly running through conjugations with instant feedback. Coupled with content you like watching/reading, the language learning process can become not only fun, but very efficient.

### What did you use to build this website?
I used Python (Django) for the backend, PostgreSQL for database management, Bootstrap for the frontend, and Heroku for deployment. I'm planning on adding either Vue.js or React on top of the current stack and using Namecheap for domain registration.
